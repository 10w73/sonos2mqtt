# External integrations

You can use sonos2mqtt perfectly fine by itself, but you can also use it in your other home automation projects.
This page displays all the community build integrations with other home automation systems.

## Add your own

If you have some great integration, you can always add a page to this repository. Checkout [serve documentation locally](https://svrooij.io/sonos2mqtt/development#run-documentation-generator-locally) for more information on how the generate the webpages from the [documentation source](https://github.com/svrooij/sonos2mqtt/tree/master/docs).
